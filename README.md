# Challenge Two
## Description
Welcome to coding challenge two, where we let the user search for
Montana county information by looking up the city. If we don't have the
city in our database, the user can then enter the license plate number
for the city, which will then load in both the county for the city and
the license plate number for the city. This data will be written to
the CSV attached to our program.
